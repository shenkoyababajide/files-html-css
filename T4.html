	<p> Links are hyperlinks and are found all around every web page. It helps to link one part of the webpage to another in-page or out-of-page source. A link can be a text, an image, a button, smiley and so on... The link tag is the [a], and its most important attribute the the "href="xxx".</p>
	<p>By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:<br>
	<ol style="background-color: white;">
	<li><a href="T1.html">An unvisited link is underlined and blue</a></li>
	<li><a href="T2.html">A visited link is underlined and purple</a></li>
	<li>An active link is underlined and red</li></ol></p>
	<h4>TEXT LINKS WITH [target] ATTRIBUTE AND ABSOLUTE URL</h4>

It has the full description path of the site like "https://www.google.com".The [target] attribute when added to the [a] tag helps to determine where the link opens; on the same page, or on a blank page. The default setting is to open the linked document on the same page. [_self] <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_self">opens the link on the same page</a>, [_blank] <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">opens the linked document on a blank page.</a>, [_parent] <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_parent">opens the link on the parent frame</a>, [_top] <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_top">opens the link in the full body of the window.</a></p>
	<h4>TEXT LINKS WITH [target] ATTRIBUTE AND RELATIVE URL</h4>

It does not have the "https://" part, for example "T2.html".The [target] attribute when added to the [a] tag helps to determine where the link opens; on the same page, or on a blank page. The default setting is to open the linked document on the same page. [_self] <a href="T2.html" target="_self">opens the link on the same page</a>, [_blank] <a href="T2.html" target="_blank">opens the linked document on a blank page.</a>, [_parent] <a href="T2.html" target="_parent">opens the link on the parent frame</a>, [_top] <a href="T2.html" target="_top">opens the link in the full body of the window.</a></p>

	<span style="font-size: 20px; background-color: blue; padding: 5px; border-radius: 15px;"><a href="T3.html"><b>GO TO JIDFAM STORE</b></a></span></p>
